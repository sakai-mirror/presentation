pt_presentation_help1=This is the Sakai Presentation tool.  It allows one or more presenters to present a set of slides to many viewers.  The presenters can move forward and backwards in the slides and the viewers follow each move within a few seconds.  The Viewers can watch the presentation in <b>Join</b> mode, or swith to <b>View</b> mode and navigate through the slides independent of the presenters.  Viewers can rejoin the show at any time.  While watching a presentation, it may take up to 10 seconds to see the new slide after the presenter advances the slide.  The viewer can refresh manually to see the latest slide if the automatic advance seems to be taking too long.
pt_presentation_help2=To create a slide presentation, upload a series of files into the Resource tool under the folder <b>Presentations</b> (case does matter).  Within the Presentations folder, each sub-folder will contain a separate presentation.  So an example pesentation might be a series of JPEG images in the folder <b>Presentations/week-01</b>.  Slide order is determined by a sort of the file names or file titles (if provided).
pt_presentation_help3=This tool can handle any web displayable image file including: GIF, PNG, and JPG.  In terms of security, if a user has write access to the resource folder which contains the presentation, they have the right to show the presentation.
pt_presentation_help4=Note: This is a relatively new tool so you may experience problems. This tool may experience performance problems if you have a large number of presentations or a large number of slides in the Presentations folder at the same time.
